# Smart Contract Test Summary

## Introduction
Today I'll be walking you through the comprehensive testing framework we've developed for our healthcare blockchain solution. Our platform securely manages patient data while enabling authorized access for doctors, insurance companies, and research purposes.

## Identity & Access Management
- **User Wallet Connectivity**: Successfully tested wallet connections with proper event emissions, ensuring users can securely connect to our platform.
- **Doctor Management**: Our DoctorOracle system validates medical professionals with complete CRUD operations and appropriate access controls.
- **Insurance Company Integration**: Similar to doctor management, insurance companies can be added, verified, and removed with proper authorization checks.

## Patient Data Control
- **Patient Sovereignty**: Each patient maintains full ownership of their health data with proper key management.
- **Access Delegation**: Patients can securely grant, deny, and revoke access to specific healthcare providers.
- **Request Workflow**: Successfully implemented and tested the complete access request workflow where doctors and insurance companies can request access to patient records.

## Data Security Architecture
- **Encryption System**: Our AES key management system ensures only authorized parties can decrypt sensitive information.
- **IPFS Integration**: Successfully tested storage and retrieval of encrypted health records via IPFS content identifiers (CIDs).
- **Research Consent**: Patients can opt-in to anonymized research usage with granular control.

## Cross-Component Integration
- **Handler Contracts**: Demonstrated seamless interaction between management oracles and individual actor contracts.
- **End-to-End Workflows**: Verified the entire access flow from request to grant with proper permissions.

## Conclusion
Our testing demonstrates a robust, secure, and user-controlled health data management system that maintains compliance with privacy requirements while enabling appropriate access for healthcare delivery and research.
